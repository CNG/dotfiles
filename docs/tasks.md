# TaskWarrior

Documenting a few basic commands here, eventually hoping to have as my personal
cheatsheet. See official [usage examples][ex].

`task add DESC [options]`, `task ID modify [options]`

* `due:eom`, `due:28th`
* `recur:monthly`, `recur:monthly until:now+1yr`
* tags: `+TAGNAME`
* `project:PROJECTNAME`


`log` is the Ñ•ame as the `add` command except the task is added in the completed
state.
