Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
Kernel message: [ 0.244042] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.702108] ACPI: [Firmware Bug]: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

maxreadreq: Test firmware has set PCI Express MaxReadReq to a higher value on
non-motherboard devices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Test firmware settings MaxReadReq for PCI Express devices.
MaxReadReq for 0000:00:02.0 is low (128).
FAILED [LOW] LowMaxReadReq: Test 1, 1 devices have low MaxReadReq settings.
Firmware may have configured these too low.

ADVICE: The MaxReadRequest size is set too low and will affect performance. It
will provide excellent bus sharing at the cost of bus data transfer rates.
Although not a critical issue, it may be worth considering setting the
MaxReadRequest size to 256 or 512 to increase throughput on the PCI Express bus.
Some drivers (for example the Brocade Fibre Channel driver) allow one to
override the firmware settings. Where possible, this BIOS configuration setting
is worth increasing it a little more for better performance at a small reduction
of bus sharing.

FAILED [LOW] DMISerialNumber: Test 2, String index 0x04 in table entry
'Processor Information (Type 4)' @ 0x000e7adb, field 'Serial Number', offset
0x20 has a default value 'To Be Filled By O.E.M.' and probably has not been
updated by the BIOS vendor.

ADVICE: The DMI table contains data which is clearly been left in a default
setting and not been configured for this machine. Somebody has probably
forgotten to define this field and it basically means this field is effectively
useless, however the kernel does not use this data so the issue is fairly low.

the Nth string from the data. For this particular DMI string the index given is
not in range which means this particular entry is broken. The Linux kernel does
not use this string, so this error will not cause any system errors.

ADVICE: DMI strings are stored in a manner that uses a special index to fetch
the Nth string from the data. For this particular DMI string the index given is
not in range which means this particular entry is broken. The Linux kernel does
not use this string, so this error will not cause any system errors.


ADVICE: It may be worth checking against section 7.14 of the System Management
BIOS (SMBIOS) Reference Specification (see http://www.dmtf.org/standards
/smbios).

mpcheck: MultiProcessor Tables tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The kernel is using the ACPI MADT for SMP configuration information, so the
Multiprocessor Tables are not used by the kernel. Any errors in the tables will
not affect the operation of Linux unless it is booted with ACPI disabled.

NOTE: Since ACPI is being used in preference to the Multiprocessor Tables, any
errors found in the mpcheck tests will be tagged as LOW errors.

PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device3 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device1 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device6 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device4 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device2 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device0 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device7 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device5 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device3 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.

Test 2 of 6: FADT checksum test.
PASSED: Test 2, FADT checksum is correct

Test 3 of 6: FADT revision test.
FADT revision: 5.0
FADT table length: 268
WARNING: Test 3, FADT revision is outdated: 5.0

ADVICE: The most recent revision of the FADT defined in the ACPI specification
is 6.2. While older revisions of the FADT can be used, newer ones may enable
additional functionality that cannot be used until the FADT is updated.


Test 4 of 6: ACPI FADT Description Table tests.
PASSED: Test 4, Only one of FIRMWARE_CTRL and X_FIRMWARE_CTRL is non-zero.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32 bit DSDT and 64 bit X_DSDT both point to the same
physical address (0x3e7fd258).

ADVICE: While it is not correct to use both of the 32- and 64-bit DSDT address
fields in recent versions of ACPI, they are at least the same address, which
keeps the kernel from getting confused. At some point, the 32-bit DSDT address
may get ignored so it is recommended that the FADT be upgraded to only use the
64-bit X_DSDT field. In the meantime, however, ACPI will still behave correctly.

PASSED: Test 4, FADT first reserved field is one (compatible with ACPI 1.0).
PASSED: Test 4, FADT second reserved field is zero.
FADT Preferred PM Profile: 2 (Mobile)
PASSED: Test 4, FADT has a valid preferred PM profile.
FADT indicates ACPI IS NOT in reduced hardware mode.
FADT SCI_INT is 9
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SMI_CMD indicates System Management Mode is supported, and
the SCI Interrupt is non-zero.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SMI ACPI enable command is non-zero, and SMM is supported.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SMI ACPI disable command is non-zero, and SMM is supported.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT indicates we are not in reduced hardware mode, and required
FACS is present.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT S4BIOS_REQ command is not set and FACS indicates it is not
supported.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT required PM1A_EVT_BLK field is non-zero
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_EVT_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_EVT_BLK fields are being used, but only
one should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at
least have a usable value.

SKIPPED: Test 4, FADT PM1B_EVT_BLK not being used.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT required PM1A_CNT_BLK field is non-zero
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_CNT_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_CNT_BLK fields are being used, but only
one should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at
least have a usable value.

SKIPPED: Test 4, FADT PM1B_CNT_BLK not being used.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM2_CNT_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM2_CNT_BLK fields are being used, but only one
should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at least
have a usable value.

PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM_TMR_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM_TMR_BLK fields are being used, but only one
should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at least
have a usable value.

PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM1_EVT_LEN >= 4.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM1_CNT_LEN >= 2.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM2_CNT_LEN >= 1.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM_TMR_LEN is 4.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT GPE0_BLK_LEN non-zero and a non-negative multiple of 2: 32.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT GPE1_BLK_LEN is zero and GPE1_BLK is not supported.
FADT GPE1_BASE is 16
Using P_BLK address of 0x1810
WARNING: Test 4, FADT P_LVL2_LAT is > 100 (101) but a P_BLK is defined. This
implies a C2 state is not supported, but there is a P_BLK register block defined
which implies there might be a C2 state that works. There is not enough
information to determine if this is expected or not.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT P_LVL3_LAT is within proper range at 57
FADT FLUSH_SIZE is 1024
FADT FLUSH_STRIDE is 16
FADT DUTY_OFFSET is 0
