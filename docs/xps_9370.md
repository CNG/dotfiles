# Suspend

On BIOS 1.6.3:

Suspend seems to work, but opening lid makes it wake up and sit on password
screen. Then it won't go back to sleep if you close the lid. This is probably
because I disabled suspend on lid close, which I generally don't want except in
the case it's already "suspended" but woken up and sitting at the password
prompt. I can apparently compensate by setting the power button to trigger suspend in `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`.

I had been having Bluetooth disappearance problems after suspend an BIOS 1.5.x,
but have not yet observed that on 1.6.1. I was going to try implementing
a [workaround](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dell-sputnik/+bug/1766825/comments/26) if it came back.
