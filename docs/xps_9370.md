# Suspend

On BIOS 1.6.3:

Suspend seems to work, but opening lid makes it wake up and sit on password
screen. Then it won't go back to sleep if you close the lid. This is probably
because I disabled suspend on lid close, which I generally don't want except in
the case it's already "suspended" but woken up and sitting at the password
prompt. I can apparently compensate by setting the power button to trigger suspend in `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`.

I had been having Bluetooth disappearance problems after suspend an BIOS 1.5.x,
but have not yet observed that on 1.6.1. I was going to try implementing
a [workaround](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dell-sputnik/+bug/1766825/comments/26)
from [forum](https://www.dell.com/community/Linux-Developer-Systems/XPS-13-9370-no-bluetooth-after-suspend/td-p/6022892/page/10)
if it came back:

Put this in `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/` by any name, `+x`:

    #!/bin/sh
    
    if [ "$1" = "pre" ]; then
      systemctl stop bluetooth && rmmod btusb
    elif [ "$1" = "post" ]; then
      modprobe btusb && systemctl start bluetooth
    fi

TODO: It came back with a vengeance, but I have not tried the workaround yet.

# Backlight problems starting beginning of 2019-02

Using kernel param `acpi_backlight=vendor` I get a `dell_backlight` item in
`xbacklight -list` output and in `/sys/class/backlight`, but it seems to have no
effect.

I went through the [Ubuntu backlight debugging document](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Debugging/Backlight)
and compiled the files in [`xps_brightness`](xps_brightness):

    aurman -S acpica
    sudo acpidump -o acpidump.txt
    acpixtract acpidump.txt
    iasl -d dsdt.dat ssdt*.dat
    rm acpidump.txt *.dat

    aurman -S fwts-git
    # with Dell external display plugged into Caldigit hub
    sudo fwts
    mv results.log results-ext_display.log
    # with nothing plugged into laptop
    sudo fwts
    mv results.log results-battery.log
    # with only power USB-C plugged in
    sudo fwts
    mv results.log results-ac_power.log

    aurman -S dmidecode
    sudo dmidecode > dmidecode

Using any of these kernel parameters did not help:

* `acpi_backlight=vendor`
* `video.use_bios_initial_backlight=0`
* `acpi_osi=`
* `video.use_native_backlight=1`
